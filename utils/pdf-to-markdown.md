# BURDEN OF TREATMENT

Will be based on factors such as number and route of medications taken, need to regularly undergo diagnostic tests and procedures considered in the preliminary rating.

# COMPLIANCE

Based on information in Appendix descending the score the examiner can opt to add percentage points.

# 5.

If adjustment of the impairment rating otherwise moves the rating to a higher or lower impairment class, the examiner should stop at the highest or lowest grade in the impairment class initially determined by the key factor. For example, if the Functional History and Physical Examination both were rated as consistent with class 4, whereas the key factor (History of Clinical Presentation) somehow placed the patient in class 2, this would preclude going any higher than 27% (grade E), although the examiner might want to be certain that the non-key factors were, indeed, correct.

# 6.

Use of the middle impairment grade in a given class as the default value under this new system would ordinarily leave one with no way to move a rating in the middle of class 4 (or the highest class in a given impairment table) to an even higher grade. In these situations, ratings for non-key factors may be used to move the rating to a higher grade in class 4 if the information regarding the other factors denotes extreme pathology. When relevant, instructions regarding how to make this determination will be provided in each table.

# 7.

Some chapters will include an assessment of the Functional History that will be used as one of the non-key factors to adjust the final impairment rating within a class by using a self-report tool such as the PDQ, QuickDASH, Lower Limb Outcomes Questionnaire, or alternative. The examining physician is to score the self-report tool and to assess results for consistency and credibility before adjusting the impairment rating higher or lower than the default value. The rating physician must provide rationale for deciding that functional test results are clinically consistent and credible.

# 8.

Some chapters will include an assessment of the BOTC in the impairment rating. These may shift the impairment grade in a class higher than it would otherwise be. Details are listed in the relevant chapters and differ among organ systems and diseases.
